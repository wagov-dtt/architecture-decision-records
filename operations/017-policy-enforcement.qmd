## Status

Proposed

## Context

Cloud infrastructure needs automated policy enforcement to prevent misconfigurations and compliance violations. Manual checking cannot scale effectively.

- [ACSC Information Security Manual (ISM)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism)
- [AWS Config Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/best-practices.html)

## Decision

Use automated policy enforcement with preventive and detective controls:

### Core Policies

- **Encryption**: Mandatory encryption for all data stores and communications
- **Access Control**: IAM least-privilege access and public resource restrictions
- **Resource Tagging**: Governance and cost allocation requirements
- **Data Sovereignty**: Geographic restrictions for compliance

### Implementation

- **Preventive**: [Service Control Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) blocking non-compliant resource creation
- **Detective**: [AWS Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html) for compliance monitoring and drift detection
- **Integration**: Policy validation in CI/CD pipelines following [ADR 010: Infrastructure as Code](010-configmgmt.qmd)
- **Alerting**: Real-time violations with exception workflows for business needs

## Consequences

### Risks of not implementing

- Security misconfigurations and data breaches
- Compliance violations and regulatory penalties
- Uncontrolled cloud spending

### Benefits

- Proactive prevention of security misconfigurations
- Automated compliance with jurisdiction requirements
- Consistent security policies across environments
