## Context

Organisations need simple, secure reporting that avoids complex JavaScript toolchains. Static reports reduce maintenance and security overhead.

- [Quarto Documentation](https://quarto.org/)
- [Evidence BI Documentation](https://evidence.dev/)
- [Government Digital Service Design Standards](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/about-digital-service-standard)

## Decision

Use Quarto for static reporting with Evidence BI for high-interactivity cases only.

### Primary: Quarto Framework

- **Static Reports**: [Markdown-based](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) with embedded visualizations
- **Multi-format**: [HTML, PDF outputs](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) from single source
- **Git Integration**: Reports alongside code in version control
- **Compliance Ready**: [Accessibility](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/) and professional formatting

### Secondary: [Evidence BI](https://evidence.dev/)

- **Limited Use**: Only useful for interactive drilldown reporting (simpler to host than e.g. PowerBI)
- **SQL-based**: Minimal JavaScript complexity

### Integration

- **Data Sources**: Connect via [ADR 018: Database Patterns](018-database-patterns.qmd)
- **Deployment**: Use [ADR 016: Web Application Edge Protection](../security/016-edge-protection.qmd) for secure distribution

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Low Maintenance**: Static reports reduce operational overhead
- **Security**: Reduced attack surface vs dynamic dashboards
- **Git Integration**: Version-controlled reports ensure consistency

### Trade-offs

- **Limited Interactivity**: Static reports lack real-time exploration
- **Learning Curve**: Teams need Quarto knowledge
