## Status

Proposed

## Context

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and Kubernetes configurations must maintain consistency between git repositories, release tags, and deployed environments. Without proper state management and version control alignment, configuration drift can occur, leading to inconsistent deployments across environments and difficulty in rollbacks or environment recreation.

- [Terraform Best Practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/recommended-practices)

## Decision

Implement strict configuration management practices ensuring git repository and release tag consistency:

**Git Repository Structure:**
- Single repository for all environment configurations
- Environment-specific directories with shared modules
- Branch protection rules for main/production branches
- Required reviews for all configuration changes

**Release Tagging:**
- Git tags must correspond to deployed infrastructure versions
- Semantic versioning for infrastructure releases (v1.0.0, v1.1.0)
- Automated tag creation through CI/CD pipeline
- Tag annotations include deployment manifest checksums

**State Management:**
- Terraform remote state with locking mechanisms
- Kubernetes GitOps with ArgoCD or Flux for state reconciliation
- Environment isolation with separate state files/namespaces
- Regular state backup and validation procedures

**Deployment Consistency:**
- Each environment deployable from specific git tag
- Automated drift detection and remediation
- Immutable infrastructure deployments where possible
- Configuration validation before deployment

## Consequences

**Risks of not implementing:**
- Configuration drift between environments
- Inability to reliably recreate environments
- Failed rollbacks due to state inconsistencies
- Security vulnerabilities from untracked configuration changes
- Compliance issues from lack of audit trail
- Deployment failures in production environments
