## Status

Accepted

## Context

The goal is to ensure the security and integrity of infrastructure throughout the deployment lifecycle. Threat actors exploit vulnerabilities in infrastructure components, misconfigurations, exposed secrets, and deployment drift.

- [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Infrastructure as Code Security Guidance](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Infrastructure_as_Code_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- [Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Guidelines for System Hardening](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cybersecurity/ism/cybersecurity-guidelines/guidelines-system-hardening)

## Decision

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repositories should follow the below standard practices (or similar equivalents) before deploying tagged workloads (indicated as low risk by [ADR 004: CI/CD Quality Assurance](../development/004-cicd.qmd)) to production environments:

- Use [Justfiles](https://just.systems/man/en/) to **manage operations tasks**.
- Use [kubectl & kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/guides/config_management/) or a [trivy supported IaC language](https://trivy.dev/latest/docs/coverage/iac/) (for example Terraform) for **config management and naming conventions**.
- Use [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/docs/configuration/) to **identify misconfigurations and exposed secrets**.
- **Maintain isolation between workloads** per [ADR 001: Application Isolation](../security/001-isolation.qmd)
- **Encrypt and audit secrets** per [ADR 005: Secrets Management](../security/005-secrets-management.qmd)
- **Test releases against several accounts or targets** like [k3d](https://k3d.io/stable/) locally and [EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/quickstart.html) on a hyperscaler per [ADR 002: AWS EKS for Cloud Workloads](../operations/002-workloads.qmd).

## Consequences

If we do not use these practices, we risk:

- Deploying infrastructure with known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
- Exposing sensitive information due to misconfigurations or hardcoded secrets.
- Compromising the integrity and reliability of our infrastructure due to inadequate testing.
- Non-compliance with legislated requirements, leading to potential legal and reputational risks.

By adopting the above baseline for our configuration management and infrastructure management, we ensure compliance with best practices, and maintain high-quality infrastructure delivery.
