## Context

Organisational systems require integration with multiple identity providers (upstream) and identity consumers (downstream) to support federated authentication and single sign-on patterns. This includes integration with jurisdiction citizen-focused identity providers, verifiable credentials platforms, and cloud identity services.

Federated identity management reduces password fatigue, improves security through centralised authentication, and enables seamless access across organisational boundaries.

- [OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet - Federation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#federated-authentication)
- [RFC 7636: Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)

## Decision

Adopt OpenID Connect (OIDC) as the standard federation protocol for all identity integration across organisational systems.

### Federation Requirements

- **Standards Compliance**: All implementations must support [Digital ID Act 2024](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2024A00069) for jurisdiction identity services
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Support [ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021](https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html) and [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) standards
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Enable integration with multiple upstream identity providers per application
- **Security Requirements**: Implement [PKCE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636) for public clients and proper token validation

### Implementation Approach

Tools and platforms (Keycloak, AWS Cognito, Microsoft Entra, etc.) will be selected based on specific project requirements, but all must implement OIDC federation patterns consistently.

## Consequences

**Benefits:**

- Consistent identity federation patterns across all organisational systems
- Standardised integration with jurisdiction citizen-focused identity providers
- Reduced complexity through unified OIDC approach
- Better security through proven federation standards

**Risks:**

- Dependency on external identity provider availability
- Complexity in multi-provider scenarios
- Token management overhead

**Mitigation:**

- Implement fallback authentication mechanisms per [OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- Monitor provider health using [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html) standards
- Use [token refresh strategies](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6) to handle temporary provider unavailability
- Maintain audit trails following [ADR 007: Centralized Security Logging](../operations/007-logging.qmd)
