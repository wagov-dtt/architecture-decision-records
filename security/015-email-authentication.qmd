## Context

Government email domains are prime targets for cybercriminals who exploit them for phishing attacks, business email compromise, and brand impersonation. Citizens and businesses expect government emails to be trustworthy, making email authentication critical for maintaining public confidence and preventing fraud.

Without proper email authentication, attackers can easily spoof government domains to conduct social engineering attacks, distribute malware, or harvest credentials from unsuspecting recipients.

## Decision

Implement email authentication standards for all government domains:

**Required Standards:**

- **SPF**: Publish records defining authorized mail servers with strict policies ("~all" or "-all")
- **DKIM**: Sign all outbound email with minimum 2048-bit RSA keys, rotate annually
- **DMARC**: Progress from "p=none" to "p=reject" with subdomain policies and reporting
- **BIMI**: Implement verified brand logos with Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)

**Implementation:**

- Monitor DNS records for tampering
- Regular authentication testing and effectiveness reviews
- Incident response procedures for authentication failures
- Integration with email security gateways

## Consequences

**Risks of not implementing:**

- Email spoofing and phishing attacks using government domains
- Brand reputation damage and reduced email deliverability
- Compliance violations with security requirements

**Benefits:**

- Significant reduction in email-based attacks
- Enhanced brand protection and email trust
- Improved compliance and threat visibility
