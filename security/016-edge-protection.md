# ADR 016: Web Application Edge Protection

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2025-08-15

## Context

Government web applications face heightened security threats including
state-sponsored attacks, DDoS campaigns by activist groups, and
sophisticated application-layer exploits targeting public services.
These attacks can disrupt critical citizen services and damage public
trust.

Traditional perimeter security is insufficient for protecting modern web
applications that serve millions of citizens. Edge protection through
CDNs and WAFs provides the first line of defense, filtering malicious
traffic before it reaches application infrastructure.

## Decision

All public web applications and APIs must use CDN with integrated WAF
protection:

```d2
direction: right

Internet: Internet/Users
CDN: CDN Edge Servers
WAF: Web Application Firewall
LoadBalancer: Load Balancer
App1: Web App 1
App2: Web App 2
Shield: DDoS Protection
SIEM: SIEM System

Internet -> CDN -> WAF -> LoadBalancer
LoadBalancer -> App1
LoadBalancer -> App2
CDN -> Shield: monitors
WAF -> SIEM: logs


```

**CDN Requirements:**

- Geographic distribution with SSL/TLS termination at edge
- Cache optimization and origin shielding
- IPv6 dual-stack support on edge (internal use of IPv4 allowed)

**WAF Protection:**

- OWASP Top 10 protection rules enabled
- Layer 7 DDoS protection and rate limiting
- Geo-blocking and bot management
- Custom rules for application-specific threats

**DDoS Protection:**

- AWS Shield Advanced or equivalent
- Real-time attack monitoring and alerting
- DDoS Response Team access

**Implementation:**

- WAF logs integrated with SIEM systems
- Fail-secure configuration (no fail-open)
- Regular penetration testing and rule tuning
- CI/CD integration for automated deployments

## Consequences

**Benefits:**

- Automated threat detection and mitigation at network edge
- Global content delivery and caching capabilities
- Comprehensive attack surface reduction through filtering
- Real-time traffic analysis and bot management

**Risks if not implemented:**

- Critical citizen services disrupted by attacks
- Direct server exposure to malicious traffic
- Slow response times affecting user adoption
- No early warning of emerging attack patterns
