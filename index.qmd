Architecture records and current decision state to support infrastructure and platform operations for Office of Digital Government (DGOV) Digital Transformation and Technology Unit (DTT). Supporting training material is available at the [DGOV Technical - DevSecOps Induction](https://soc.cyber.wa.gov.au/training/devsecops-induction/) (guided by the [WA Cyber Security Policy](https://www.wa.gov.au/government/publications/2024-wa-government-cyber-security-policy)). 

The [Architecture Principles](./architecture-principles.md) guide all decisions documented here.

## ADR Categories

The repository holds lightweight, version-controlled architecture decision records organized by domain:

### Development (3 ADRs)

**Focus:** Code quality, Application Programming Interface (API) standards, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and release management.

**Key Decisions:**

- Adopt OpenAPI specification for documented APIs
- Implement security-first CI/CD with automated prechecks  
- Standardize release documentation with change tracking

### Operations (5 ADRs)

**Focus:** Infrastructure management, logging, monitoring, backups, and configuration consistency.

**Key Decisions:**

- Adopt Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) auto mode for workloads
- Collect security logs into centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tooling
- Deploy Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with misconfiguration detection
- Enforce consistent config state (*Proposed*)
- Use object storage for backups (*Proposed*)

### Security (4 ADRs)

**Focus:** Application isolation, access controls, compliance, secrets management, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance.

**Key Decisions:**

- Isolate applications and environments by default
- Adopt AWS Secrets Manager with automated rotation
- Require pre-approval for AI tools (*Proposed*)
- Sandbox AI tools with access controls (*Proposed*)
