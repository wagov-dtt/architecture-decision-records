title: "Architecture Decision Records"

Architecture records and current decision state to support infrastructure and platform operations for DGOV DTT Team. Supporting training material is available at the [DGOV Technical - DevSecOps Induction](https://soc.cyber.wa.gov.au/training/devsecops-induction/) (guided by the [WA Cyber Security Policy](https://www.wa.gov.au/government/publications/2024-wa-government-cyber-security-policy)). The [Architecture Principles](./architecture-principles.md) used to guide decisions are also in this repository for reference.

## Structure

The repository holds lightweight version controlled architecture decision records. On acceptance of a record a new tagged release should be made and this readme updated.

### [Development](/development/) - Decisions to design, develop, build and test software securely

### [Operations](/operations/) - Decisions to support how infrastructure workloads are released and operated

References: [CNCF Cloud native landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/)

### [Security](/security/) - Decisions to uphold security and design controls

## How to Document Decisions

Architecture decisions should be stored in version control so there is a record of what was changed, who by, and when. We use the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) format, proposed by Michael Nygard.

Each record should have:
- **Title**: a description of the decision (not the problem)
- **Status**: Proposed|Accepted|Deprecated|Superseded  
- **Context**: the facts behind the need to make the decision
- **Decision**: what the team has decided to do
- **Consequences**: both positive and negative consequences (start with 'risks of not implementing')
